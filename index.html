                Take the time to navigate our site here and you can read about OsloMet's
                climbing wall and lesson hall. These two places at OsloMet are two important places
                for our group, these places at school help students with learning and physical activity.
                Physical activity is extremely important for moments, it is extremely easy for IT moments and becoming too stagnant this easily
                affects our physical and mental health This can lead to a higher likelihood of depression and dropping out of study. The lesson hall
                is important because it is where the teacher teaches us the academic we need to grow as students. The combination of these two important
                places at OsloMet makes it the two most important places in the school in our opinion.
