            <p>
                Take the time to explore our site. You can read about OsloMet's lecture hall, climbing wall, fake news and accessibility. 
                These two places at OsloMet are two important places for our group, these places at school help students with learning and physical activity.
                Physical activity is extremely important for moments, it is extremely easy for IT moments and becoming too stagnant this easily affects our physical and mental health. 
                This can lead to a higher likelihood of depression and dropping out of study. 
                The lesson hall is important because it is where the teacher teaches us the academic we need to grow as students. 
                The combination of these two important places at OsloMet makes it the two most important places in the school in our opinion.
