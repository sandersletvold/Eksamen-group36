                One of the most unintended consequences artificial intelligence can bring is that it can potentially lead to fewer jobs.
                As we know, machines can perform drastically faster work than a human. This results in unemployment rising and the economy slowing.
                People with low education are going to be most affected. We can also imagine that AI (artificial intelligence),
                makes processes easier done and accurate analyses. But can also come with unpredictable outcomes that affect individuals,
                communities or society as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the legal justice system must keep a constant eye on how developments will keep pace with the technological laws,
                and also what their progress will look like in the future. So that it can protect the rights of everyone. 
                The only way to solve this is to develop a legal framework that makes sure that everything complies with the law and create safe regulations that are suitable,
                so that unique problems are created by artificial intelligence/technology are prevented.
            </p>
            <p>
                Artificial intelligence can also help spread a lot of misinformation, such as deepfakes, manipulated videos and, for example, 
                the general election we will have in 2025. "The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, 
                or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage".

                It is a good argument for how dangerous it can be if the technology falls into the wrong hands. But with proper regulation and a framework, 
                this can be prevented. If Parliament and the Court come together with a proposal that avoids these problems, then this can be adopted.

            <h2 class="secondary-headings">The use of AI in politics</h2>
            <p>
                AI can have in political influences in situations and elections. It is related to society and technology because political campaigns can be influenced by this technology, 
                which goes beyond society's perceptions of, for example, government and the state. 
                An example of this is in Canada where a mayoral candidate used AI-generated images of homeless people in that city, 
                where he talked extensively about fighting poverty and homelessness  
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/25/technology/ai-elections-disinformation-guardrails.html">(Hsu & Lee Myers, 2023)</a>. 
                This can be problematic as voters may feel deceived by politicians not using images of real situations and events.
